            If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

            Stay home, most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home,
            except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing,
            or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.
